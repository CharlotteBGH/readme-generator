# README Generator 

## Description
For this task, I had to create a command-line application that generate README files from a user's input. The purpose of this is to save time for developers so they can spend more time on projects. It uses util, inquirer and fs, as well as a gitignore file so the node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub.

## How it works 
The application is invoked by using the command 'node index.js'. The user is taken through a series of prompts, which in turn returns a README.md file that contains a license badge and the following headings (with the section content submitted by the user): 
- Title
- Description
- Table of Contents
- Installation
- Usage
- License
- Contributing
- Tests
- Questions

## Usage
To try out the application for yourself, clone the repo, download inquirer using npm i inquirer, and invoke the index.js file using 'node index.js'. Then respond to each of the prompts in the Integrated Terminal. Your README file will be generated to the left of your screen.
